      Gzip, which stands for GNU zip, is a file compression and decompression
      tool and format commonly used in Unix and Linux environments. It is also
      used in web servers and browsers to compress web content, such as HTML,
      CSS, JavaScript, and other text-based files, to reduce data transfer times
      and improve website performance. Here are some key points about Gzip
      compression: Compression Algorithm: Gzip uses the DEFLATE compression
      algorithm, which combines the LZ77 algorithm for string matching and
      Huffman coding for symbol encoding. This results in efficient compression
      of data. File Format: Gzip typically compresses single files or streams of
      data. It appends a ".gz" file extension to compressed files, making it
      easy to identify them.

      Command-Line Tool: Gzip can be used as a command-line tool in Unix and
      Linux systems. You can compress files using the gzip command and
      decompress them using the gunzip command. To compress a file: gzip
      filename To decompress a file: gunzip filename.gz HTTP Compression: Gzip
      compression is widely used in web servers and browsers to reduce the size
      of web content before sending it over the network. When a web server
      supports Gzip compression, it can send Gzipped content to the browser. The
      browser then decompresses the content and renders it.

      Encoding Header: In the context of web servers and browsers, Gzip
      compression is indicated in the HTTP request and response headers. The
      "Content-Encoding" header field is used to specify that the content is
      compressed with Gzip. This reduces the amount of data transferred over the
      internet, making websites load faster. Efficiency: Gzip is especially
      effective for compressing text-based files, such as HTML, XML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and JSON. It may not be as efficient for already compressed
      files (e.g., multimedia files like images, videos, or already compressed
      archives like ZIP or tar.gz files).

      Overall, Gzip compression is a widely used and effective method for
      reducing file sizes, which is beneficial for data transfer efficiency,
      storage, and web performance optimization.
